# **Dodonpachi DFK BL Arrange - No Lock-On Sound**

Patch that removes the beeping lock-on sound effect entirely from the Ketsui-themed arrange mode, of Dodonpachi DFK (aka Resurrection) on Steam. It has no other effect.

## Patching Instructions:

1 - From the installed Dodonpachi DFK folder (the one where default.exe is), go to \res\DISKDATA\F\.

2 - Using your xdelta patcher of choice, apply the dfkblarr-nlos.xdelta patch to the file named "msoe.bin". Make sure that your patched file has the same filename as the original.

##### NOTE 1: Keeping a backup of both the original and patched msoe.bin is a good idea, so they can be switched out whenever. But also because Steam at some point, might randomly decide, to revert the patched file back to the original state.

##### NOTE 2: The patching process can be verified with the hashes below:
